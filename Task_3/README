Imports
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

‚ñ∂Ô∏è What this means:

pandas is for handling data in table format

matplotlib.pyplot is for making charts

seaborn is for advanced, pretty charts
These are the most common tools for data analysis.

Loading the data
python
Copy
Edit
df = pd.read_csv("student_info.csv")
‚ñ∂Ô∏è What this means:
This reads the student dataset from a CSV file and loads it into a dataframe called df, which acts like a table in memory so you can work with it easily.

üìä Visualizations
Now you made multiple graphs ‚Äî I‚Äôll explain each one line by line:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Bar Chart: Average Math Score by Grade Level
python
Copy
Edit
avg_math = df.groupby("grade_level")["math_score"].mean()
avg_math.plot(kind="bar", color="skyblue")
plt.title("Average Math Score by Grade Level")
plt.xlabel("Grade Level")
plt.ylabel("Average Math Score")
plt.show()
‚ñ∂Ô∏è What this does:

Groups data by grade_level

Calculates average math score for each grade

Shows it as a sky blue bar chart

Adds a title and axis labels

Finally shows the chart

Why? ‚Üí It tells you which grades are doing better in math on average.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Histogram: Study Hours
python
Copy
Edit
plt.hist(df["study_hours"], bins=10, color="green", edgecolor="black")
plt.title("Study Hours Distribution")
plt.xlabel("Study Hours")
plt.ylabel("Number of Students")
plt.show()
‚ñ∂Ô∏è What this does:

Makes a histogram of the study_hours column

Divides the hours into 10 bins

Bars colored green with black edges

Adds a title and labels

Shows the chart

Why? ‚Üí You can see whether most students study a lot or just a little.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Pie Chart: Gender Distribution
python
Copy
Edit
gender_counts = df["gender"].value_counts()
plt.pie(gender_counts, labels=gender_counts.index, autopct="%.1f%%", startangle=90)
plt.title("Gender Distribution")
plt.show()
‚ñ∂Ô∏è What this does:

Counts how many male/female students

Makes a pie chart showing the proportions

Adds labels and percentage labels

Rotates the chart for better look

Shows it

Why? ‚Üí Helps you see the gender balance in the dataset.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Line Chart: Average Attendance Rate by Grade
python
Copy
Edit
avg_attendance = df.groupby("grade_level")["attendance_rate"].mean()
avg_attendance.plot(kind="line", marker="o", color="purple")
plt.title("Average Attendance Rate by Grade")
plt.xlabel("Grade Level")
plt.ylabel("Attendance Rate (%)")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
‚ñ∂Ô∏è What this does:

Groups data by grade level

Calculates mean attendance rate per grade

Plots it as a purple line with circular markers

Adds a title, axis labels, and a grid

Shows it

Why? ‚Üí Lets you see whether higher grades attend school more or less.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Bar Chart: Final Results by Grade Level
python
Copy
Edit
result_counts = df.groupby(["grade_level", "final_result"]).size().unstack(fill_value=0)
result_counts.plot(kind="bar", stacked=True, figsize=(8,5), colormap="Accent")
plt.title("Final Results by Grade Level")
plt.xlabel("Grade Level")
plt.ylabel("Number of Students")
plt.show()
‚ñ∂Ô∏è What this does:

Groups data by grade level and final result (pass/fail)

Counts how many students in each group

Reshapes it so you can stack bars

Makes a stacked bar chart with colors

Adds a title and labels

Shows it

Why? ‚Üí Helps you see how many students passed or failed per grade.
